# odin-recipes
This project is part of the HTML foundations section of The Odin Project. The goal is to build a simple recipe website using only basic HTML. The site will include a main homepage and several linked recipe pages.

By completing this project, I will demonstrate an understanding of:

Structuring content using semantic HTML

Creating and linking multiple HTML pages

Using elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, and images

Navigating file structure and linking with relative paths
